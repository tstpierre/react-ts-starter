# react-ts-starter
Boilerplate for creating a React application with TypeScript and Webpack


### Requirements
- [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)


### Usage
1. Clone repo and specify target folder if desired
2. Update HTML title in `./webpackConfig/html.config.json`
3. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
4. Run hot module reload dev server with `yarn run devserver` or build with `yarn run build`

---
### Development Tips
- Run `yarn run devserver` in one terminal window
- Run `yarn run devtest` in another terminal window

This will allow you to actively write app code and unit test code with continuous webpack HMR and test runs.
